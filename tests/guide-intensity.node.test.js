// THE GUIDE GROWS MORE INTENSE AS YOU GET CLOSER, AND NEVER GOES SILENT (#84 item 2, ADR-0105).
//
// Moved from the engine with the guide (ADR-0257): the same seven claims over the pure mapping.
//
// ========================= WHY CONTINUOUS =========================
// No repeating ping — the Dev's verdict: «um ping é a pior escolha possível, tenebroso para quem tem TEA». The guide is a
// continuous presence — nothing fires, the thing just becomes more present.
//
// The axis is BRIGHTNESS, with a small share of volume on top, and the choice is the Dev's. The redundancy is not
// decoration: for a child with hearing loss the brightness may fall in a band they cannot reach, and two axes mean
// neither decides alone.
//
// MUTATIONS CHECKED (at the end of the file).

// ========================= MUTATIONS CHECKED =========================
// Run on 2026-09-27 in this repository, each alone and restored after — all red (the engine's five, carried over):
//   · G1 `FAR_VOL = 0` → «it NEVER goes mute». It is the defect that would make «far» sound like «no target».
//   · G2 a linear cutoff (`FAR_CUT + (NEAR_CUT - FAR_CUT) * near`) → the EXPONENTIAL brightness case.
//   · G3 an exponential volume too → «the VOLUME is linear»: the two axes would accelerate at the same point.
//   · G4 no saturation (`Math.min(1, …)` dropped) → «it NEVER goes mute», below the floor beyond twelve steps.
//   · G5 `STEPS_TO_FLOOR = 8` → TWO fail: both axes growing together, and the scale's floor against the sonar's ruler.
